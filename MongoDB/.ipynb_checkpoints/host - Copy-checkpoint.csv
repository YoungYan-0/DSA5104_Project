Having been a tenant in Bangkok before, I knew what expats wanted, whether for a short or long-term stay - kitchens, big bathrooms, good management and no Thai tricks with deposits and hidden charges. Voila Sanctuary House... Our guests love us, so try to book ahead when possible. I have lived in Bangkok for over 8 years. We have a friendly and helpful management style while giving you all the privacy and freedom you need. I look forward to welcoming you to Bangkok and to Sanctuary House, our little oasis of peace and quiet in the heart of the Big Mango. |within an hour|1.0|1.0|1|Sathorn|1|1|1|1

For me life is about doing the right thing, and a rich life is based on sharing experiences with people I care about and appreciating the (sometimes complicated) beauty of everything.I am fairly social but also need privacy and time-alone. As a guest, I am very respectful of my host's home and his/her thresholds for interaction/solitude and somewhat expect the same of my guests when hosting.I am always interested in leaving my comfort zone, even just a little bit, and learn something new. |a few days or more|0.0|0.0|0|Upper Sukhumvit|1|1|1|1

I was and still am a farmer’s daughter from a small village in  Thailand. I was picking fruit and planting rice until I was eighteen years old. I crazy to get to go to University and ended up starting a language school in Bangkok. I’ve enjoyed travelling to Africa and America and Nepal and some other places which are interesting but in the end I think you can’t find a better place on earth than a Thai village and I spend one week every month on my own organic village farm in Isaan, still picking fruit and planting trees. I started collecting country-style antiques when I was in college and then started helping renovate small properties in a Sukhumvit neighborhood where I know everyone and get all the gossip from the beauty salon every week. I like what Americans call “loft style” and I use wood from old houses and country antiques like you might find in a french restaurant but I upgrade everything with modern conveniences.I’ve taught Thai to almost a thousand students, American and European and Japanese, and I have many old friends all over the world from this experience. I like helping people who share my style get started living in Thailand. If I have a property I’m working on that might fit what they need that would be very nice but if I don’t I’m still happy to talk to them.I love books and films and especially old fashioned British costume dramas, my favorite is ""Pride and Prejudice"". I am also interested in Asian foods, history and customs of India, and languages (English, Japanese, Lao, Cambodian, and even a little bit of Swahili!)"||0.0|0.0|0|Bang Na|0|1|0|0

In particular we have a huge heart for SE Asia. Our beautiful honeymoon was spent in Bali where we were charmed everyday by the most lovely experiences. We currently have a small but lovely apartment overlooking the Chao Phrya river in Bangkok as most of my business in fashion keeps me there. When we are stateside we live in Oysterville, Washington, and also own a second home in Portland, Oregon.We are great supporters of the arts and try to see performance as well as exhibits as much as is possible when we travel. Often my business takes me to amazing destinations, as international fashion means international travel as well. My most recent trips have been a month long adventure from that took me and my husband from NYC to London, Milan and Paris to document a fashion week experience. We're considerate and responsible people who understand the importance of trust in renting your place to those you have never met.  We appreciate it when our guests do the same with our two historic homes, one on the charming historic Willapa bay in Oysterville, Washington, the other a beatiful 100+ year old victorian in Portland,OR which is perched high enough upon a hillside for an outstanding city view. Our homes are filled with precious things so we understand the importance of knowing that those things will be taken care of in our absence.Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have; as I will do the same. I've used airbnb on many occasions and feel comfortable that the system makes this a wonderful and safe experience.Thanks for reading!Melissa |within a day|1.0|0.27|0|Banglampoo|1|1|0|1

I started hosted on Airbnb since 2013 as a hobby but now it's my full time job. :) As I love traveling and also love any chance to meet new people and learning new culture from around the world. My other passion beside traveling is food. Most of the time when I travel, these two passions collided. I normally end up planning my trip based on where I'm going to eat that day. :D I also love to cook. But it's not really worth it to cook in Bangkok when you live alone. It's much cheaper to just eat out. So If you'd like to try a traditional home cooked meal, I'll be more than happy to prepare something for you. Please check me out on Airbnb Experience. It was launched in Bangkok on March 16th, 2017 and I'm one of the first 9 hosts in Bangkok. My first experience is called ""Thai Delight"". And my 2nd experience ""Pad Thai Cooking Class"" was also now launched in September, 2017. :)Looking forward to hosting all of you. Cheers,TatiyaPs.

5260755|T|2013-02-28|Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates|Good day and thank you for your interest in the apartment.  I’m a frequent flyer and travel specialist. My job allows me to travel around the world, experience new cultures and meet interesting folk and I love every minute of it. The great thing about the AirBnB concept is that it allows you to feel right at home in a new city. I personally avoid tourist traps and prefer to explore the neighbourhoods, sample the street food and check out the local watering holes – that’s the best way to get to know a place. But I also know it’s important to feel safe and not sacrifice your creature comforts. That’s why I’ve decided to open the doors to my lovely Bangkok homes, so you too can feel right at home in a foreign land. Don’t be an armchair traveller. There’s much to love about Bangkok and staying at The River or The Loft's will make it just that much sweeter.  Cheers, ||0.0|0.0|0|Upper Sukhumvit|1|1|0|1

For me, and my partner Khun ice, we are delighted that we can now offer people the chance to stay in the kind of place we would choose for ourselves.  Ice is from Thailand: he is the professional hotelier, restauranteur and chef while I'm the enthusiastic amateur, originally from the UK, who's other job is in advertising.  Bangkok is our home; we 'live above the shop' and love to welcome friends and guests to visit and stay in the Residences - each one has a name (Herma House and Maison ice). In addition, we have a restaurant next door  called Tapi; it serves your breakfast (Thai, Chinese or American) and for lunch and the evening really good, authentic Thai food indoors or outside at night in the garden.  We now have a number of very individual branches of Cafe ice in Bangkok that are happily proving quite popular. When there is time, we love to travel to Europe, America, Australia and to explore other parts of Asia; we try to stay in smaller, more intimate hotels and guesthouses like ours, to exchange ideas and learn from others. Antiques, art, fashion, design, photography and culture & music discovered and rediscovered, in new and familiar places, are of interest, as are the many new friends we are lucky to make on the way.

1774390|Add|2012-02-19|Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand|Born and raised in Thailand, I spent a couple of years living in Washington, D.C. However, I am now permanently based in Bangkok. My work, in the insurance industry, requires me to constantly travel, so I seldom spend time at home. There's nothing more that I love more than traveling, and I've visited over 40 countries and counting. I have one son who is based in New York. I enjoy fine food and appreciate good music. I am also a big fan of Thai massage, and I run a small spa in Bangkok as a small, side business. I can't wait to get to know and meet new people from all over the globe, especially if we have any interests in common. In other words, I am more than happy to take guests out for a drink and introduce them to Thailand.

10289027|Erik|2013-11-27|Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand|10 years ago on December 5th (the Kings birthday) I arrived in Bangkok. I fell in love with this city almost immediately. Bangkok symbolizes all the excitement, craziness and mystery that is Asia. I have lived in Asia since I was 12 but no city is as addictive to me as Bangkok is. This place is the full flavor of the Asian experience, and even with the buzz of a big city I have never felt anything but safe here. I have seen and done almost everything in Bangkok and I can't get enough, this is not a city that easlily bores you.  My interests and work all involve eating, cooking and experiencing the good things in life, I am constantly searching for new places to eat, street food to enjoy and cool places to share time with friends or making new ones. I am interested in fitness and a healthy lifestyle and having as good of a time as possible. Bangkok is well suited in that regard as the possibilities here are endless. I hope to be able to share my best eating spots, nightlife recommendations and Bangkok only tips with people who are likeminded. I hope that your trip is as fantastic and stress free as possible and that you go home as positive about Bangkok as I am. I go out of my way to make your accommodation as comfortable and convenient as possible. I am a relaxed and friendly person but serious about what I do and strive to provide the best and most convenient places to stay in Bangkok. Everything and anything you might need will be taken care off so I hope to see you soon! |within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

That 's where I discovered so many interesting things. There are so many different ways of thinking/working to achieve the same goal. The different cultures make different perceptions of people. The different geography gives different climate and alimentary. I enjoyed seeing many wonderful places, trying many different delicious foods and drinks, and obviously doing shoppings is the most important part of my traveling :)I knew airbnb 3 years ago and I like very much the way it works. I had opportunities to exchange with many hosts which most of them were so impressive and helpful. That 's why I decided to be the host when I 'm back so that I could have a chance to welcome different visitors.Bangkok has so many different interesting places, foods, things to discover. We hope our place could be part of your memorable trip in Bangkok.||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|1|1

I love traveling, and thanks to my job, I have been able to visit and live in some unique countries worldwide. Thailand is (of course!) one of my favorite destinations and somewhere that I have decided to call 'home,' but in addition to Thailand, I love Bali, South Africa, Hong Kong, and Rajasthan in India. I enjoy sharing my homes in Thailand with others who love to travel but enjoy the creature comforts of somewhere to call 'home' at the end of a day.

Now I am in Kenya.My hometown is Bangkok, Thailand. I have two apartments there. One is being rented out on a long term contract and another one is posted on airbnb.1I love what I do, which is teaching.

I go out occasionally but never too late. Traveling opportunities can be varied depending on the country I am in and how much I am willing to spend.In my free time, I enjoy swimming, sitting by the poolside, watching TV, reading online junks, playing with my cat, dinning with friends, and napping.Some may say that I travel a lot but I know people who travel way more.

30262097|Dr. Supot|2015-03-30|Phuket, Phuket, Thailand|We are not property agent or broker, most of the property listed are ours, as we have been buying these properties (some properties are rented from others for long term and refurnished to meet our standard). Our team will take care you all very well with quick communication by the Host or co-host or our staff in each property. We will assist you to make your stay a wonderful stay (Home away from Home). We use some of these properties for ourselves as our vacation home, when there is opportunity such as during our children school holiday.I have many apartments for rent and they are all located in prime prime prime locations.

We are flexible and shall accommodate your requests as much as we can. Please give us a trial and you will love our service and you will know how much we care for you guys. This has proved with my SUPERHOST for last 6 years and Great Review given by most travelers.My name is Supot (I graduated Doctor in Business Administrative -DBA). Most of the apartments are prepared for Workation with Strong WIFI, LAN wire (if needed), self check in either pick up keys from mailbox or get keys from security guard at main door or from our staff or from reception, depending property by property. We have listed more than 30 apartments so it is not possible for me to meet you personally. I have been in Banking service and Hospitality business for more than 20 years, so I do understand what travelers are looking for, such as strong WIFI, comfortable mattress, linens, pillows, towels and amenities. The proof of such experience shows in my overall review of 5 stars in most of bookings. I spend my holiday on golf, scuba diving, swimming, biking and love to travel to new destinations. I believe in GOD and destiny, so I do pray everyday as my routine: morning and evening. We can talk about all these activities. My motto is to think positive and every problems have their own solutions, so do not worry. God help those who help themselves.I have tried hard to keep my SUPERHOST in every quarter, that why you will get service as per your requirements. Please keep in touch and keep me inform all the times of your issues, I promise I can solve all the issues. Do not keep such issues quite in your mind, then write a review of such unhappiness, which the Host has never been told or a chance to address such issues. Thanks in advance for supporting our family by staying at our places. My family is depending on your support, so we would like to thank GOD and you all for such support. LOVE YOU ALL.

36401443|Taak & Vora|2015-06-22|Bangkok, Thailand|We are a married couple living and working in Bangkok. The husband is an Interior Architect, having graduated from RMIT University Melbourne and currently owns own architectural firm. The wife is a graduate of Mahidol University in Bangkok, and used to work for Thai Airways International but currently holds several even more prestigious positions; School-bus driver, Chef, Head of Housekeeping and general Commander-in-Chief to 2 children and 3 cats.As a family, we love to travel to see and experience new things that open up our perspectives and views of the world. We love the opportunity to expose our children to different cultures and diversities, and learn how the locals of each country live. Because of Taak's background as an Interior Designer, when travelling we tend to look for unique places to stay that are somewhat design-oriented. It does not need to be luxurious in terms of looks, but we believe true luxury is how you feel in a space. We prefer subtle simplicity but with an attention to detail in providing comfort and privacy. Our current favourite destination is Japan, especially Kyoto. And also Switzerland. In fact, we tend to be impressed wherever we go...we just love to travel! Our favourite food would be Thai food (obviously) as well as Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Mexican, French and Korean. And anything BBQ. Love that!Something else about us... Father and Son are avid F1 fans (never miss a race) and are passionate about football, go-kart racing, and Legos. Mother and Daughter are more fashionistas and into watching movies, cooking shows and lovers of cheese.Despite our love of travel Bangkok will always truly be our home, and where we are happiest. We hope to welcome you to our favourite city and perhaps you may fall in love with it too!|within an hour|1.0|1.0|1|Upper Sukhumvit|1|1|1|1

I lived in Paris, Nice, Marrakech, Funchal, Bali and am established in Bangkok for the past 16 years. I travel extensively all around the world and I enjoy it very much.After 2 complicated years, Bangkok is coming back to life as tourism resumes. Street vendors are back, and we can see normal activities in shopping areas. Soon it will be the coolest capital city in the world again. It is easy to live here. What do I like here? thaï food of course, especially the spicy stuff! Also the Thai people are gentle and considerate. I also like the fact and it is never cold! I hear some people complaining about the traffic, but hop on a moto taxi, and you are where you want to be in no time for a couple of dollars; or use the air-conditioned subway or the sky train (cleanest public transports ever) and the traffic jams disappear.I am sure you will like it too!

I was born in Bangkok and grown up in Bangkok, the hometown that I love and wish you love too. Life is short. I wish I could travel around the world, explore new things and experience the way people live, things to eat. I have read a book ""around the world in 80 trades"" written by Conor Woodman. I wish I could travel like him. Right now, I've listed 2 apartments with AirBnB, which located in Rama 1 road where my childhood began. I grown up at Chula Soi 8, walked and played at National stadium. My flashback memory picture was taken at National Stadium garden with my mom and my five gangs elder brothers-in-law. I grown up around here. Therefore, I am proud to present the area where I belong to you. Travel was like a dream when I was childhood. My grandfather asked me to be his companion when I was 7. Just only that conversation, I daydreamed for many days because it would be my first trip aboard. Unfortunately, my grandfather cancelled the trip. Daydreaming collapsed. My first aboard trip was to the UK to study English course for 1 month. I was super excited. It was 11 years old at that time, traveled with schoolmates. I had a good experience. It's still fresh memory, I am so happy when I think about it. I would like to be apart of your good memory when you visit Bangkok. I am please to welcome you to my apartment where the area I belong.

45326725|Eric|2015-09-28|Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand|Sawasdee khrap dear travellers!I’m Eric; like Eric Clapton yeah, but being a French citizen :-)I was born in Saint-Nazaire, South of Brittany, where the biggest commercial cruises in the world keep emerging - 'Sovereign of the Seas' or 'Queen Marry 2' might ring you a bell - and was raised in Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, a 12,000 inhabitants seaside resort located right on the other side of the famous Saint-Nazaire bridge. Some family holidays spent in Vietnam during summer 2000 gave me a crush for Asia. I came back in Asia, precisely in Bangkok, for internship purpose during my last year of studies and since never really came back to France, apart from holidays of course.Therefore, I did work for a various type of industries including tourism, textile, corporate gifts, hospitality and even decided to take the challenge launching my own company, running premiums trading and F&B businesses.Off work, I like dining out, mingling with new people, traveling, swimming and watching sports. Arguing is a also a French national sport I do enjoy… softly! I consider myself as being serious and friendly with a humorous behaviour.Being a host on Airbnb are both a pride and a great responsibility. A pride to be offering my private spaces as an unique accommodation alternative in the land of smile; a responsibility to welcoming my guests in the best conditions and, if possible, even exceeding their expectations.I'm looking forward to participating in the success of your beautiful journey in the City of Angels and getting your stay simply smooth as silk.Siamese regards,Eric|within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|1|0

We are new to this and have decided that we will test the waters and see how it goes, because of this our condo is priced very cheaply in the hope that we can build a better profile, get some feed back from guests so that we can make it a better service and also hopefully put some positive reviews on our page.About us. Im Neil,  originally from Scotland, I have been working and traveling world wide for about 10 years now, based in Bangkok for 6 of them and living in metro park for the last 2. I love to travel, meet new people and experience new things. I love the nights when my friends and I meet like minded travellers. We have shown some cool people the best bits of this city, the best bars/food that tourists never find and had some great nights out. I was basically a tourist here for 4 years and would love to pass my knowledge on and help make your trip unforgettable.Yui my wife, Is a local city girl from here in west Bangkok. She has a great local knowledge and will be able to point you in the right direction of any markets,shops,attractions and transport with in Thailand. Hopefully a little bit of local know how will make your trip much smoother and relaxed.

Meanwhile I did some renovation, hope you enjoy!A business man with family in Bangkok, 3 grown up daughters. We live in a separate house on the same premises, so guests have full privacy. My hobby is golfing and a huge fan of nature, the separate house for lease is set in the midst of a serene garden. Would love to share the beautiful house with people who will appreciate. In 2016, I went to Kampaeng Phet Province of Thailand and got some locals to build stunning wood houses to put in the heart of Bangkok. It is how rural Thai people live, because wood block out the heat in this region. I am eager to share with everyone from abroad how real Thailand is. Not only touristy flashy Bangkok. Hope you will appreciate.We have many cute pets living in our yard: peacocks, tortoise, cat, dog, chickens, fishes.

My hobbies vary from travel, reading, watching Woody Allen's and Wes Anderson's movies to dancing to great music, cooking and eating (most preferred), and having a lot of fun with family and friends. I have a long list of favourite food, from Mexican to Japanese, Italian, Indian, and Thai! I also love chocolate and lots of books.Above anything else, I love exploring the world. If you also one of the travel enthusiast, we will definitely have something in common! The place you see form my list is a condo my mom and I own together, originally planned as a place to spend our weekends. However, as we learned about Airbnb, we kinda changed our plan to let other people who love to travel as well as stay in a luxurious place, to have a marvellous experience at our place.  |within a few hours|1.0|0.5|0||1|1|0|0

I  bought a room in a condominium, close to the Chaopraya river, the largest river in Thailand. The place is half an hour drive to my office.  I am on Airbnb coz I love traveling. I work hard and I need to get my mind off work once in a while so  I will have one or two big trips every year to places overseas and small trips locally. I love to indulge myself in good food and drinks. But I try to shed off extra calories by playing tennis every week and going to gym as often as I can. As a host, I want to make sure that a guest will enjoy staying at my place. I have a small kitchen, Cable TV, and a good Wifi. My condo has a good gym and big pool. A guest should keep my room clean, that is it. My life mottos are Work hard, play harder, and Be loyal to yourself and everyone around you. ||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|1|1

All the design, decoration and furnishings are my own input and I wish for all those who stay to enjoy the warm welcoming feel.My passion lies with travelling and I am fortunate to have traveled in Thailand, Southeast Asia. but also to have lived in Australia for eight months while on a student exchange and more recently I made a few week trip to Europe.

My dream is to see all the world and i hope one day i will achieve it.Well i started my first foreign visit in 2016 when i got a job oppotunity in Thailand and was very excited to come here and see this country of smile. I came here and started living in Bangkok and traveling around the other provinces in Thailand.I noticed something that its difficult to find good place to stay in a budget price. As a solo traveler I met many foriegn travelers and back packersand came to know that many of them were on short budget trip. So they can not pay much for a good place to stay with good location. That gave me an idea to open Savi rooms and here i am :-)Savi rooms offers you different categories of stay in budget price and ensure that you will feel like ""A home away from your home"".Its at one of a prime location of Bangkok, RCA which is famous for its night life with many pubs and discos around like Route66 and Onyx. Also its at ease access of super market, Piyavet hospital, Rama 9 hospital and Bangkok hospital, super market, ATMs, Taxi and motorbike taxi 24 hours.I recommend you to try this place once and i am sure you will love it :-)Hope to server you better soon !!Regards,Savi"||0.0|0.0|0|Yan Nawa|1|1|1|1

My full-time job is a flight attendant at the moment. The main reason that I have been doing Airbnb because I love to meet people, make new friends and show them around in my city.I have a degree in social science majoring in politics. I love WAKEBOARDING, traveling, the outdoors, eating new food, drinking craft beer, discovering new cultures, new music, meeting, and getting to know people from all over the world to share life experience. I have travelled to many places on this lovely planet, from Asia and Australia to Europe, Africa, and North America. I would say travelling is my drug of choice. I have dreams that I may one day live and work internationally. One last thing I breathe music, so if you are keen genres like house, deep house, techno, drum & bass, old school hip hop, jazz, or any funky music then we speak the same language. Do share with me some cool jams! Sharing is Caring.You can reach me on FaceB > Kay Dybala MY LINE ID : first81Look forward to seeing you guys.|within an hour|1.0|1.0|0|Chatuchak|1|1|0|1

7009055|Hermann|2013-06-19|England, United Kingdom|I live both in the UK and Thailand.  And I call them both homes.  I spend roughly half my time in either of these two places.  They actually serve both as homes as well as hubs to me to be more precise. While in Asia, Bangkok becomes my Asian hub.  I do extensive travelling around the region and also beyond.  Similarly my UK home is my European hub obviously.Whenever I travel, my place in Bangkok becomes unused, hence the idea of letting couples or families wanting the experience of staying in an unusually designed apartment to use. This 160 sq metre apartment spans across two levels on the very top floors of a condominium in the very heart of Bangkok -- the prestigious Ratchadamri area, where several 5 and 6-star hotels are located.I have a huge love and passion in design -- every kind and form of design, including that of a living space.  I design my homes not entirely to make them look good.  My priority is to make a home highly livable and very home, with every details of home living thoroughly considered and taken care of.  Of course, the doing of this can never be at the expense of not having them aesthetically pleasing.I hope you will like the look and feel of this uncharacteristically designed home in Bangkok, and of course eventually enjoy staying in it.  It is the result of a lot of passion and hard work.Hope to meet you in person one day.||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|0|1

From here, you can take a long-tail boat to old-town area and the Grand Palace. Bangkok's biggest park, Lumpini, is 2 train stations away.

18478154|Num|2014-07-20|Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand|Hi, I'm Num, a 39-year-old university lecturer, born and raised in Bangkok. I spent some time in the US and the UK, studying theatre and performing arts and got my PhD in Drama from the University of Exeter. Apart from occasionally acting, I am also a certified yoga teacher and teach private classes, as well as group classes at Yogatique studio in Asok area (check it out!).I love dogs and I'm a proud owner of an Alaskan Malamute (Quint), a Siberian Husky (Kai) and 2 Pomeranians (Care and Code). I love them so much that I name my small pet care brands after them (Quint and Kai)! Bangkok is a relatively pet-friendly city. Even though you won't find people walking their dogs in public parks, there are many pet cafes where you can go and hang out with cute dogs and cats. There are dog swimming pools around the city, and if I am in Bangkok, I usually take them swimming at weekends. So, if you are a pet lover too, we will definitely get along really well! I can show you where to go get pet care products as well (some souvenirs for your pets waiting for you at home?)Thank you for your interest in my listing! I'm looking forward to making new friends. Apart from introducing you to local theatres, yoga studios, and some pet shops, I would be really happy to recommend places to get great coffee, authentic Thai food and decent drinks!|within a day|0.8|0.67|0|Din Daeng/Huai Khwang|1|1|1|1
48069192|Sam|2015-11-03|Bangkok, Thailand|An ailurophile working for a Fin-Tech start-up in Thailand. I have six house cats, who should *fingers crossed* miss me while I'm away. I started traveling at a young age, thanks to my globe-trotting parents who, due to the nature of their work, now travel even more frequently than me. At 12th grade, I received an AFS scholarship to study in the U.S. There I stayed with a host family in Kansas City, a decent Midwest city with a famous baseball team and barbecue. I moved on to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, studying magazine journalism and international relations, graduated and moved again to Washington D.C., where I interned for a non-profit organization named Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Traveling for me is very much about living like a local. Sure I'll hit some touristy spots, but what I love more than anything is retracing the local way of life. I love nature, and I love convenience. I love tradition, and I love modernity. But they must coexist in an authentic way. I like a place with strong character, be it a tatami house or a yurt, and is comfortable enough that I don't freeze/burn up at night, am able to leisurely take a shower and can sleep without fear of crawly creatures. Privacy is a big concern, but I LOVE interacting with locals and learning from them, so I'm very open to conversations and social gatherings. I'm not a party animal and I don't like big crowds, so if the place is residential, with a live-in host and all the conveniences a local needs nearby, I'm in. |within a few hours|1.0|1.0|1|Din Daeng/Huai Khwang|1|1|1|1

Eat out or bring it back to the room. This is how Thai's eat everyday. Authentic as it gets.""Sleep""BZ27 has 39 small apartments in a 5 story walk-up (No elevator). We rent 34 of them out to local students, office workers and others who work in the Sathorn area. We keep 5 rooms for daily rentals. All rooms have been recently renovated and we are vigilant about keeping them as clean as possible. The neighborhood is safe and BZ27's security is very good as well. We have a front gate, second floor accessible by electronic key card for tenants and guest and 16 CCTV cameras.""Stay local""This is the most important aspect for our guests. BZ27 is located in bustling local neighborhood. If do not like to explore and expect easy access to all the tourist destinations, than BZ27 is not for you. Although we are only 2.2km from Surasak BTS station and local transportation & taxis are easy to get, Bangkok traffic is congested. So for all you adventurous folk that I haven't scared off, BZ27 is actually in a great location!Normally I try to meet and greet each guest and help them get settled in, but if you're flying in late or real earlier, I'll probably be sleeping. I do not live at BZ27, so I am around between 9am - 5pm daily. We do however have a key lock box out front to handle 24 hour check ins. Drop me a message if you have any questions. Thanks!Sincerely,Frank B"|within an hour|1.0|1.0|1|Sathorn|1|1|0|1

I used to live in Bangkok to be close at work, and now stay at this house and  enjoy so much morning cycling around the area.  There are many temples along Chao-praya River, Koh kred Island, interesting housing and life styles  along the Chao-praya river and canals connected to it, floating markets, rice and lotus fields.  I become to realize that the feeling of all scenes and personal touch when driving a car and biking are much different in many aspects and details.   We don't feel the same on the same routes we pass by because things along the way we have seen are changing everyday, this week you will see people are preparing rice fields, a few weeks later will be all green, and then become golden rice, etc.  It's such a peaceful dynamic.

147744788|Tao|2017-08-26|Bangkok, Thailand|My name is Tao, Managing Director, Interior Designer, and owner of Baannai.I am taking this opportunity to introduce you to my house which I name it as Baannai, a small and well designed house located in the old Bangkok residential area of Phayathai District.  There are 4 rooms in this house which has been opened since December 2015.  It is right opposite to Samsen railway station and within 10-minutes drive to Ari BTS (Sky train) station and Bangsue  MRT station.  The hotel is close to Ari, hip hang our area of Bangkok, as well as the famous Jatujak Weekend Market.  Other nearby attractions include Phayathai Palace and Sri Ratchawat fresh market.Baannai was the house on the most inner area of the vast family land plot by Samsen Railway station in Bangkok.  It was originally the residence of my great grandfather and his family.   Later, the place became the residence of three of his daughters (known as the Baannai ladies). Back in the days, the houses in this neighborhood only had soil road cut through, with a narrow ditch creating a parallel, and train tracks.  My great grandfather’s family was an extended family just like most Thai people’s in the past. The big family resided together on a big piece of land, divided into the resident area and the kitchen house, lived in by both the masters and servants. Home that was filled with mundane joy and sorrow, harmony, and conflicts; nonetheless, they relied on each other and had a family leader who gave protection to all members. My great aunts - the Baannai ladies- always recalled the life in Baannai back then. The cooks would steam a huge portion of rice for each meal.  As the bell rang signaling lunch or dinner time, small children would gather in a circle having their meal together.  This went on every day.  Just like an old saying, “The family that eats together stays together.” Inspired by the happy recollections of my beloved Baannai ladies combined with my passion in colonial architecture style, I decided to rebuild Baannai to resemble the time when the 3 sisters were young ladies living in the house.  The three upstair rooms – Benjamas (Aster), Malisorn (Jasmine), and Kularb (Rose) are decorated in different style representing the character of each lady to which each room belongs.  The room downstair, Botan (Peony), is decorated in Chinese style, representing the room for the guests of the house.  The lobby of the hotel is also functioned as the dining room of our restaurant.  Selected as one of 'Bib Gourmand' restaurants in the Michelin Guide Bangkok 2018 and 2019, Baannai is famous for its traditional Thai food inspired from the family recipe, some of which are from a cook book hand-written by one of the Baannai ladies herself. What I have is the memory that glows in my hearts. I wish Baannai would bridge the past and the present days and bring happiness, comfort, generosity to all the visitors who make a stop here.  I hope that you will find this information useful and interesting.  I am looking forward to progressive and prosperous future of Baannai with your support.Best regards,Tao||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|0|1

However, I start using Airbnb as a guest (since 2012) for traveling abroad, so I understand well what guests need most for traveling away from home. I am the first one responsible for every inquiry, answering any question and setting the price/calendar on Airbnb.

After retiring, my husband and I have traveled to many places around the globe. My husband Pod loves cooking and gardening.  We have two daughters living abroad and that's why we sometimes feel quite lonely to live in this big house. So we decided to join airbnb to welcome guests from all around the world, hoping to meet new people, to make new friends. Although we are a new host, we are confident that our experience from travelling to many countries would help in offering our place to be your ""home away from home"".

8956615|Andy|2013-09-20|Bangkok, Thailand|Hi My Dear travel friends,I was born and live in Bangkok.I'm a business owner and I love to travel around the world once or twice a year like you guys do - I guess ^^ I  love bicycle , swimming, joking, going to gym and reading.I dream to have my own boutique hotel here in Bangkok, but why do that? because of Airbnb. I think I don't need it anymore. lol When I travel to New York or anywhere in the world. I like to use AirbnbI think it explore the new world of travel experience. You will feel and touchthe local rather than staying at the hotel and of course, cheaper ! 55This is the best way to learn and feel of that country and people. And it will make you have more experience and best of all the good memory that you can't find if you staying hotel or come with the group tour package. Ok, too long story I think.  Wrap it up. I'm here because I'm the one who're the same as you guys. Travelling, eating, sleeping, slow life...etc.So I find several places that perfect for you guys to stay and easy to access by any mean of transports.  Believe me , you have to stay with the one that feel like you, not the one that do it for business purpose only. I know what you want and love. That's all !!See ya Soon. |within an hour|1.0|0.88|0|Din Daeng/Huai Khwang|1|1|0|1

My place is located near BTS and not too far from Suvarnabhumi International Airport (18 KM by taxi or by BTS to Phayathai Station then connect to Airport Link) and Donmuange International  Airport (34 KM by taxi or by using BTS to Mo Chit station and then taxi to Donmuange International Airport). I would love to assist you with your plan to visit Bangkok or outside Bangkok.I can Speak English and some Japanese but very limited as I just started to study my Japanese Language in September 2017 and I will continue it for next year.

My English is intermediate but I would try my best to help foreigner tourists to be impressed with beautiful Bangkok and Thailand.I am a father of 2 beautiful infants, so I enjoy taking them out to explore the world.Before I became a father, I enjoy going backpack abroad with my wife. However after I have kids, we have to change our way of travelling to a tour package as it's too difficult to travel with luggage while keeping our eyes on the kids. We might need to wait till the kids grow up a bit before we can start our backpack trip again.สต||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|0|0

We believed that great trips start and end with accommodations, therefore, we guarantee safety and comfortable experience for our guests. One of our facilities is a large common room which we coined ""Tuk Tuk Lounge"" is designed for travelers from all over the world to meet and exchange their cultures and experiences through activities and gatherings. These include the movie room, gaming room, pool table, reading room and board games. Our hostel is located at Pata Department Store, one of the oldest and most renowned department stores in Thailand. Within few steps, our guests could find themselves surrounded with enjoyable places such as the zoo, badminton court, fitness center and arcade gaming. Moreover, one of the most recognizable aspects of Thailand is certainly Thailand's street food. With this matter, we could put it as simply as whatever you can think of, you can find them near us. Tuk Tuk Hostel is also within a walkable distance of Bangkok's landmarks, for example, Wat Phra Kaew or Temple of Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Grand Palace and Khaosan Road.Furthermore, what differentiates us from other hostels is that we are at the center of transportation. It is highly convenient for travelers to stay with us then travel to different parts of Bangkok and Thailand via bus stations, Southern Bus Terminals (for sea-lovers to explore Thai beaches) and soon to be opened Bangkok Mass Transportation System (BTS) or sky train."||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|0|0

""My siblings and I grew up seeing our parents welcoming family members, her colleagues both foreigners and Thais , at our house.  These fond childhood memories have inspired me and my sister to build a hotel on our family land where we can also welcome guests to enjoy the same, wonderful experiences we had when we were young.We are two sisters who founded this newly built hotel located on the Thonburi side of the Chao Praya River on a tract of land belonging to the Xuto family. It is only 15 min-walk to Wat Arun or temple of dawn and right next to the MRT Itsaraphap station ( blue line ) which is scheduled to open in Sep 2019.  Both of us have taken an early retirement from corporate companies to run this hotel with our passion and we  ensure that guests feel perfectly at home with our while getting the hand of Thonburi' s cultural life. We treat our guests like a friend and family members by giving our guests advises on cultural events , things to do and where to go.  The hotel has only ten bedrooms and all spacious and unique in design.   Each room has design inspiration from the local attraction in Thonburi where guests can visit each place easily with our free  map.I (Noom) am  also a painter and love any forms of art like jewelry design to  cartoon drawing.  In our hotel, guests will experience local arts including my painting. Our place is sparkling new , clean with pool and garden. "||0.0|0.0|0|Bangkok Yai|1|1|0|0

2973845|C&C Residences|2012-07-18|Bangkok, Thailand|Hello and Sawasdee.I'm born in Thailand but lived in UK for more than 30 years. I don't feel that I have been away for long as I come back to Thailand and the SE Asia so frequent that it's hard to feel detached. Having graduated from the University of the Arts, I worked in London for IPC Media, RICS and recently at the FT for a few years only to realise the more I saw of SE Asia, the more I wanted to spend time there. I now reside here in Bangkok and still consider it one of the most exciting cities in the world. It really is a central hub for everything. It's not hard to fall in love with this city with it's sights & sounds or the wonderful concoction of flavours of food (street or fine dining) that Bangkok has to offer.I love travelling and enjoy visiting historic sites, architecture or simply seeing how people live. I also love food and photography to which fortunately, they all seem to compliment one another. For you foodies, this neighbourhood has some of the best food around. Famous noodle joint 4 mins away, excellent Bibimbap just next to Emporium shopping centre, Wine Connection which has a good selection of western food and is very family friendly. Whether you want me to assist or recommend, I would be more than happy to assist or recommend and ensure you get the best experiences during your stay and make this truly a home-away-from-home.|within an hour|0.86|1.0|0|Lower Sukhumvit|1|1|0|1

We enjoy learning new culture, tasting local food, cherishing beauty of nature and making new friends! During our last visit to Europe in Spring 2018, we spent more than 40 nights in AIRbnb houses/apartments and we totally love the experience! So we decided to open our own place for AIRbnb as well. We do hope our future guests will have a great time during their stay in BKK, so we will always make sure that our condominium is clean and in perfect conditions for our guests. [ WEDNESDAY ROUTINE ]Basically we would need to use our condominium everyday wednesday night for Bible Study Group, so that allow us to open our place for AIRbnb for the rest of the week. If you're looking at our listing and want to book your stay which fall on Wed or you intend to book for a long term stay, please feel free to let us know. We'll see if we can manage to free our schedule for you.[ OUR BIO ]Haosen G. (Chinese) - HusbandZuzi W. (Thai) - Wife/Full time mom||0.0|0.0|0|Siam|1|1|0|0

Currently I am based in Singapore, also offer Airbnb experience, you can book here as well. I travel very frequently for work so I have decided to rent out my apartments to good travelers with a reasonable price. So far I have listings in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Bangkok and San Francisco. Convenience is my top priority when selecting places myself thus all my places are located in the heart of the city center and very easy access to train or other public transportations. You would also expect luxury amenities from 5 star hotels (which I collected from my travels :). There are also coffee/tea, water, snacks inside the room. Also I greet all my guests in person and offer as many local tips as I can. A city is made up of  the people living inside, thus I want my guests to enjoy not just the tourist spots but also good hospitality and warm welcome from local people. |within a few hours|0.88|1.0|0|People's Square|1|1|0|1

257460041|Dandora|2019-04-22|Bangkok, Thailand|Aspira D'Andora at Sukhumvit 16  Nestled amidst this vibrant city of Bangkok, is a truly inspiring boutique hotel called Aspira D’Andora.Aspira d’ Andora, original inspiration stems from the quiet little country of Andorra perched high in the Pyrenees. Solitude, calmness and inspiration is the essence of Aspira D’Andora, a truly unique hideaway yet within easy walking distance of the main artery Sukhumvit, where one can hop on the sky train, or delve into the depths of this vibrant and often chaotic city on the MRT underground train or simply explore the kaleidoscope of modern shopping malls.The sense of arrival is all embracing, be it the funky artifacts, the nurturing colors or lemongrass aroma, or the vibes all communicates a sense of well-being while one is escorted to the communal lounge for a refreshing Thai welcome drink and formalities. Breakfast is served at the communal lounge where all day beverages are available.Each of the 23 accommodations is individually designed a story in itself, be it from the imported antique woods that adorn the floor, the 14’’ high quality bed that guarantees the perfect slumber, or the multi-tasking walk-in shower space plotted amidst granite texture color plus the collage of artworks that adorns the walls crowned off with a splattering of lights above the headboard to set your mood. Blazingly swift free Wi-Fi, large LCD TV, refrigerator, complimentary tea/coffee plus multiple ports to re-charge your devices are all just a touch away.A truly fabulous location offering a broad range of truly international restaurants, lounges, wine bars, coffee shops, noted points include Terminal 21, Emquartier and Emporium shopping malls, a traditional Muay Thai training centre, short stroll to Asoke BTS or Benjakiti Park to keep your jogging or whatever in form makes Aspira D’Andora the perfect choice for a truly inspiring and memorable stay in Bangkok.|within a few hours|1.0|1.0|0|Klong Toey|1|1|0|0

Let me know what I can do to make your trip a memorable one :).Bangkok is a beautiful city of smile, collectivism , awesome food, relaxation, beautiful culture but also notorious for mosquitos, simple-made-complicated and mark ups. No worries, that is why there are so many blogs, communities made available for tourists and expats. Don't be scared to ask for assistance.More over, maid service, laundry service, wine service, interpretation service, toddler stroller available for rent.

While walking a few steps to the heart of Bangkok's business district.Our house is the original house of people living in the traditional Silom area which is rare today.We want to preserve this 80-year-old wooden house in order to maintain the spirit of the old generations. Although the renovation of an old house is more difficult than creating a new one. Especially in the city center where land prices are soaring.What we want is not just a house. But a warm home to rest and relax from the hustle and bustle of the city center. A home that makes life slow down. Let us have time to enjoy music, arts that are hidden in various corners of the house, relax with the sound of birds and trees, energize your life.||0.0|0.91|0|Silom|1|1|0|1

Worked in Japan for a few years, I love traveling around, I have been to most of the Asia countries and recently start to explore the different city in Europe.My job is actually quite busy, I work at investment company, its hard for me to plan something too far ahead in the schedule, but thanks to those travel apps platforms like Airbnb etc, from planning a trip to booking accommodation or even airport pick up, I prefer the flexibility and how easy I can always just plan my trip and leave the next day. I also like to join the small local tour when I get to the city too. When I bought this apt in Bangkok, I was thinking my friends and family can come use it but turn out that they all want to travel to Japan! I am hesitate to do the Aribnb host but until I found a local host to assist me. For me clean and tidy place is what I would look for when I book my accommodation and so I would also hope to keep my apt clean and tidy for my guest as well as for myself.|within an hour|1.0|1.0|1||1|1|0|1

This one is the Paradisaical Hideaway home with luxury beachfront residenceis. Private pool. Private house maids. Party is allowed. Very fantastic place for company team-building, family holiday or business/work-related function. For this list, it requires for query for reservation. No instant booking.On all calendars, you may find booking windows for 3 months in to the future due to unpreditable sitaution of Covid.If you find that there is something missing, I am happy to listen and improve for better stay.Hope you enjoy your trip wherever you are.

While studying over there I used to work part-time at a gift store beside Disneyland, remembered how much fun to be able to interact with people from all over the world, I started renovating my place in 2017.

36808034|Lalana|2015-06-26|Bangkok, Thailand|I was born and raised in Bangkok, so I always want to be a good host for my foreigner friends and guests when they're having a trip in my hometown.My background is about marketing but I also studied art history and art business in London. Let me know if you're interested in visiting some nice museums or cool galleries in Bangkok. Or we could go to an exhibition opening together if it's the right time :)I love going to see live musics, mostly jazz. I could name some if you like it too. Sometimes when I'm traveling, I wish I could just chill with my music and relax at my place. So I've got a bluetooth speaker for you guys. Hope you enjoy it!Movies is my best friend. Doesn't matter if it's a Hollywood blockbuster, an independent production or any kind of niche genre. I like Netflix, so I provide that at my place as well. My favorite place at all time, wherever I go or whichever cities I visit, is parks. Unfortunately, there're not many parks in Bangkok. But I'm sure I could recommend some nice parks and you'd love them. My favorite thing to do is traveling. Apart from appreciating beautiful places, it broadens my perspective and shapes me how to live my life somehow. Also meeting nice and cool people is  the best. Basically, I find sharing is beautiful. That's why I prefer staying at Airbnb than hotels, and now become a host. Hope you have a good time here :) x|within an hour|1.0|0.97|1|Suan Luang|1|1|0|1

So when I went to undergraduates, I chose the exhibition design as my major. After I graduated from the U.S. I decided to be a wedding planner and now I fly to different cities, whenever there is a wedding case. The wedding planner is a career that can bring both myself and others happiness. I am very proud of what I've chosen for a lifelong career.I wish you would like my home as much as I do. It is not the size that makes a place home, but its coziness. I think you will find my place cozy.Thailand is a diverse and romantic country. Though she is not perfect, you will find its sweetness as long as you bring your lovely self.嗨， 我叫Lisa， 是一个泰籍华裔。欢迎来到泰国！因为从小喜欢做手工，所以长大学了设计。从美国回来后就做了一个婚礼策划师。每次根据不同地点的婚礼飞去不同的城市。策划婚礼师是一个可以给别人带来幸福感，也能给自己带来幸福感的工作。做一个房东，布置自己的家也是一样。所以，非常希望你们也能喜欢我的家，家不在于它的大小，而在于它的温度。希望我的小窝能给你温馨的感觉。泰国是一个很多元很浪漫的国度，她可能并不完美，但是只要带上可爱的心情，路上的一切都变得可爱起来。|within a day|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

I grew up admist the busyness of Bangkok's Pratunam district, which to many Thais is considered the true city center, marked by Ratchaprasong intersection. Naturally, this has shaped my preference for accommodations when I travel, so I always make sure to choose a safe place in the city center that I can step out of and be immediately immersed in the hustle and bustle! This place offers just that :)  I am so glad that you have chosen my beloved city as your travel destination, and it would be my pleasure to welcome you to my home.|within an hour|1.0|0.95|0|Ratchathewi/Phaya Thai|1|1|0|1

284367031|James N.|2019-08-09|Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand|Hello and Sawasdee.I'm born in Thailand but lived in UK for more than 30 years. I don't feel that I have been away for long as I come back to Thailand and the SE Asia so frequent that it's hard to feel detached. Having graduated from the University of the Arts, I worked in London for IPC Media, RICS and recently at the FT for a few years only to realise the more I saw of SE Asia, the more I wanted to spend time there. I now reside here in Bangkok and still consider it one of the most exciting cities in the world. It really is a central hub for everything. It's not hard to fall in love with this city with it's sights & sounds or the wonderful concoction of flavours of food (street or fine dining) that Bangkok has to offer.I love travelling and enjoy visiting historic sites, architecture or simply seeing how people live. I also love food and photography to which fortunately, they all seem to compliment one another. For you foodies, this neighbourhood has some of the best food around. Famous noodle joint 4 mins away, excellent Bibimbap just next to Emporium shopping centre, Wine Connection which has a good selection of western food and is very family friendly. Whether you want me to assist or recommend, I would be more than happy to assist or recommend and ensure you get the best experiences during your stay and make this truly a home-away-from-home.|within a few hours|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

7297277|Mads Herluf|2013-07-05|Bangkok, Thailand|I have many years of experience renting out my places and understand what it means to be a host and all the effort it takes to make a place great for visitors.I appreciate good conversations with international people and to make new friends. A peaceful cheerful extrovert who enjoys both nature as well as city-life and always open for adventure. I'm a non-smoker, I don't drink and I am not particularly attached to any faith or religion.I run my own online business together with my girlfriend. I like to use this freedom to travel for both pleasure and business.It is fundamental to me to show respect to people around me, also in regard to noise and tidiness.||0.0|0.0|0||1|1|1|1

1295674|Aor|2011-10-15|Bangkok, Thailand|I'm a lifelong Bangkok resident, but I love to travel the world. Wherever I go, I try to stay in vacation homes, bed & breakfasts, or apartments. I prefer to live like a local where possible rather than just stay in hotels. I would like to stay in a cozy place by a river or a farm house where I can explore the natural surroundings.As I mentioned, I've always had a passion for travel. As the Digital Media Manager at an international travel publication, I stay updated on all best places to go to. Some of my favorite trips have been to the US, Switzerland, China, Japan, and New Zealand. The vacation I will always remember the most though was in Santorini, Greece. I love to experience all sorts of different things, from national parks in North America to traditional culture in China to chili crab in Singapore.Photography is my obsession and I never go on a trip without my camera. I love taking pictures of whatever inspires me, but I'm especially moved by natural landscapes.I would be happy to host people and show them around my area. Please contact me of you are interested.=======I received Community Award in Airbnb Bangkok Host Event Awards for 2015. It was for the part of my contribution to Airbnb community. And I have continued contributing and keeping the community inspired :-D|within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

After a few years studying abroad in Europe and working in the United States, I decided to come back home and work in Bangkok. Originally born and raised in Chiang Mai, I am a small-town girl at heart (even though Chiang Mai isn't so small anymore). At the moment I often travel back-and-forth between Chiang Mai and Bangkok. When I am in Bangkok I would stay in Apt.2 of Nakara Ari (along with my family), which is actually an old family home that was just newly renovated! Therefore, if you have any questions, any need during your stay, or just want to get to know me over a coffee (or glass of wine/G&T), just let me know! Please feel free to get in contact with me about anything, anytime and I will do my best to answer you as quickly as possible! I look forward to hosting you :)|within an hour|1.0|0.86|1|Aree|0|1|0|1

I have had the opportunity to see about 30 countries, half of which have come through Airbnb.

322674519|Varaporn|2019-12-30|Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand|I have been working at Rangsit University as an instructor in the faculty of Food Technology for 30 years. My husband is an electrical engineer. I am the second generation of family running apartment business.  Varaphorn House has been well-known for a long term leasing apartment by foreigners who come to work in Bangkok.  Our family business has been run efficiently by my mom for more than 40 years. Now she is old to manage all so that she passed on the baton to me. The tourism business is steadily growing up together with the new trends and innovations. Travel has changed over the last century, from only a few people could afford to that many can accomplish.  Even the place to stay it seems to change from the luxury hotel with full services like restaurants, bar, or gym to the boutique hotel or small one having unique characteristics.  With the aids of applications on mobile or computer, for example,  Airbnb, it makes travellers comfort to choose their own places to stay as wish. I am seeing the opportunity on Varaphorn House to keep up with the new tourism trends.  Since Varaphorn house was built 50 years ago, it was designed by concerning the strength of building, and plenty spaces of living and utility area due to the unlimited space and cheap cost of land in Bangkok at that time.  Today, the modern apartments and condominiums on the other hand, provide narrow rooms due to the limit space and expensive cost of land.  Imagine! staying in the room of 100 sqm comparing with a 25-40  sqm room , which one is more comfortable? With the vintage style, having only10 rooms, a large size 100 sqm of room space, private swimming pool, beautiful garden, and calm environment amid the busy business around here, I am sure that Varaporn House must meet the need of travellers. Thus, I decide to renovate only 2 rooms on the fourth floor with the best view of our house for doing business with Airbnb . Come to stay with us, you will feel like staying at your home.   |within a few hours|1.0|0.0|0|Aree|1|1|1|0

21131324|Promporn|2014-09-09|Bangkok, Thailand|Sawasdee ka! Nice to meet you!I'm a busy working mother who lives in Bangkok. I love traveling and I love my family. Traveling with my family, I now prefer accommodations with cooking / kitchen facilities and the extra bedroom and bathroom! That's how I got onto Airbnb and since then I've also enjoyed interacting and making new friends - guests and hosts. To escape the city, Hua Hin is our favourite destination. It is close to Bangkok, isn't too busy, has many good restaurants and things to do. When vacationing I just want to relax and to be outdoors sitting next to the beach. My children love to play on the beach and to swim. Our Resort in Hua Hin offers the best for me and my family as it isn't busy like Hotels, has lots of beautiful outdoor areas and many swimming pools (for my children to explore!). Some people may prefer a more central location, but I like that the Resort is just before Hua Hin, so we can escape the traffic in town.If this sounds like you too, feel free to stay at our Home, or to contact me. FYI, seafood is the best in this area. I have many tips and can share restaurant recommendations with you later. :)|within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

My taste is minimalist and refined, and this is reflected in my homes. I value the finer things in life, and that includes relationships; I'm there, but only when you need me, and nothing matters more than making my guests (and hosts) feel happy and at ease. And if at the end of your stay you've made a new friend, you've made one for life. So I suppose there's only one thing left to say: Welcome home! |within a day|0.5|1.0|1||1|1|1|1

I like having the freedom to travel and not worry about paying my rent when I'm away because I can take in Airbnb guests to help me cover the costs. The apartments I rent out are my personal homes, so please respect my things and treat the apartments as you would treat your own. I'm not trying to make money from this, I just don't want to be paying rent for places that aren't being used. I really love the neighbourhoods i live in, they're very central, have loads of great cafes and famous restaurants and are awesome locations for seeing the other areas of the city. |within a few hours|0.8|0.95|0|Da'an|0|1|0|1

One of my favorite place to visit for a short getaway is definitely Bangkok, where I can shop, have a daily dose of Thai massage and indulge in my favorite tom yum soup! It is my great pleasure to welcome you to one of my apartments located in Nana/Sukhumvit area. I am sure you will have a blast!|within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

409999802|Guillaume|2021-06-30|Surat Thani, Thailand|Hello everyone ! My name is Guillaume, I know it’s difficult to pronounce, sorry for that.I’m a big traveler, I traveled all over Europe and Asia and my favorite places are Germany, Portugal, Morocco, Bali, Japan and of course Thailand. I loved so much Thailand that I decided to live here, on the beautiful island of Koh Phangan.I’m a very curious person so I have many passions, hobbies and center of interest that might seems opposites from each other. I am as much an artist as a scientist. I love to paint, produce and listen to music, do crafts to make things beautiful in my house and am also interested on comptuters, quantum physics, new technologies and meditation.I love science fiction and fantastic books and movies, but I also love good comedies. I love vegan food (I’m vegetarian), Asian food in general and my girlfriend’s food (she’s perfect, I am so lucky)Besides, I decided to work on the psychosomatic field. I try to understand the reasons in the mind or the unconscious that created physical or emotional blocages. That’s a new field discover by science and use by psychologist right know and I find it fascinating. As a host, I refuse that guests make parties, no pets because it’s not allowed in the condominium and no prostitution (I don’t know how to write it with diplomacy but I’m fully aware that it will be difficult to control) for ethical reasons.The most important thing for me as a host is for the guest to be respectful about furniture and apartment itself and of course, neighbors and people working on the condo.Smoking is allowed but only in the balcony (there is fire protection devices inside of the apartment so they can be activated by smoking inside the apartment.)My life motto is that I deeply believe in karma and I try to be the best version of myself and the Universe finds a way to give me back this positive energy!|within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful.Your time is limited, so dont waste it living someone else's life....Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become!Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see. Excellence is the result of caring more than others think is wise, risking more than others think is safe, dreaming more than others think is practical, and expecting more than others think is possible.I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship.Kindness is the mark of faith; and whoever has not kindness, has not faith.Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, chocolate in one hand, wine in the other, body thoroughly used up, totally worn out and screaming...Damn, What a ride! |within an hour|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|1|1

In India, we have the highest regard for guests and their hospitality. I have travelled a lot and it has been a great experience, so great that I decided to welcome travellers to my abode. In my spare time, I like to write about the places I visit. It gives me immense pleasure to have you here and create great moments because trust me, we are good at it!If you are looking for a home away from your home then I have got your back. Have you seen any Bollywood movie showing Indian hospitality? That's the kind of love you will get from my side. I beg to differ from Linkin Park because in the end something matters! and that something is that lovely smile on your face. Can’t wait to see you in my little paradise. I am more than happy to back you in your travel plans as well. Feel free to shoot any queries you may have.“If you were meant to stay in one place we would have roots instead of feet”.Happy Traveling!|within an hour|0.9|0.81|0||1|1|1|1

I like meeting new people and sharing cultures and experiences. When I travel, one of my must-do activity is to try local food.

77845666|Anita|2016-06-15|Samut Prakan, Thailand|Hi everyone!My name is Anita. I'm originally from Hong Kong but grew up between Bangkok and Vancouver, Canada. Worked in Singapore for 3 years before moving back home. I can speak Cantonese and Mandarin!I love to meet new people, eat, and embark on adventures to explore different parts of the world. Travelling puts my life into perspective: i'm reminded of how minute my problems are in the grand scheme of things and most importantly,  I'm encouraged to live life with a more humble heart. My most memorable destinations to date has been the Sahara Desert in Morocco, Vinicunca Mountain in Peru and, Wadi Rum in Jordan. Let me know where yours are!Designing a home isn't just about choosing a style. It's more of a  platform to share the things I feel deeply passionate about. For me, these are: my love for travelling as well as, my love for hosting. From the welcome baskets to the choice of bedding, I want my homes to be a place where guests feel comfortable, at ease and welcomed.  Stay with me and I'll be sure to introduce you to a local side of Bangkok you've never seen before.NOTE: I will be out of country from June 11 - July 3rd 2022. Since I will be in a different time zone, my response may be slower than usual. My lovely cleaner will assist you during this time. |within a few hours|1.0|1.0|0||1|1|0|1

436718146|Nittaya|2021-12-20|TH|Green Lung Villas are situated in the center of Bangkok's only true oasis; Bangkrachao island, or as it is more commonly known, 'the Green Lung of Bangkok'.  While the villas are approximately a half hour, 20km drive from central Bangkok, the serenity, privacy and surroundings give the impression of being many hundreds of miles away from the capital.  For Bangkok's locals, expats or tourists, the villas are an ideal break from city life without the long journey.Green Lung Villas currently has two properties; one 3-bed and one 2-bed. Completely designed for self-catered living, both brand new private villas (est. Jan 2022) have comfy air conditioned living rooms and well equipped kitchens.  The adjoining outdoor spaces feature BBQs and multiple seating areas including dining tables under shady, breezy salas. Each villa has a private 10m pool, a child's paddling area and two sunbeds. All bedrooms are en-suite, air conditioned and fully furnished with blackout curtains, high ceilings and countryside views.For those who prefer more activity than simply relaxing by the pool, the island is well known as a great place to explore on foot or by bicycle. We can also offer boat trips, kickboxing lessons and trips to the botanical park or floating market. There are several excellent restaurants and cafes within 2km of the villas.Your hosts Dtom (Thai / Eng) and David (Eng) personally manage the properties, live next door and can provide help, local knowledge and some supplies that you may need throughout your stay. They look forward to welcoming you soon.|within an hour|1.0|1.0|1||1|1|0|0

32804855|Sven|2015-05-07|Bangkok|I am living in Thailand since the mid 80s and have built a few for me and my family to enjoy the holidays. Haus Uthland is our family home on the Northern German Island of Sylt.As we are still too busy we have decided to rent our home for a period of time.When in Phuket, I do enjoy the evenings most, a nice sundowner followed by a BBQ.Haus Uthland is a property built in 1760, it is for generations in our family. Traveling to the island of Sylt is a passion. My aunt is the owner and manages the place. The two homes in Bangkok we keep for guests and long term tenants.Please visit us, we are always happy to meet new people from all over the world.||0.0|0.5|0||1|1|1|1

183480083|浩洋|2018-04-10|Bangkok, Thailand|厌倦了千篇一律的生活，背上行囊，迈向远方。坐在Pandas Hotel的长椅上阅读《海子的诗》，享受清晨的静谧，饭后在院子里散步逗猫，午夜静听拍打在瓦片上的雨声，接受它的洗礼。休憩在这个中泰结合的小院里，仿佛置身于温暖的家乡。听着异国民谣，体验当地的风土人情。对酒当歌，人生几何？简单而又丰沛的日子绿植 / 摇椅 / 有猫 / 还有你愿你此行能够找到向往的生活，明确的方向，追随内心的祈求。无论你经历过怎样怅然若失的暗哑时光，它都将化作一粒种子，慢慢发芽长大，壮硕柔韧的枝蔓会支撑着你，直到繁花如烟火般绽放的灿烂盛景。带着你的故事来Pandas Hotel吧，我在小院等你。|a few days or more|0.4|1.0|0||1|1|0|1
