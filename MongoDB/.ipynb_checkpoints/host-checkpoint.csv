I crazy to get to go to University and ended up starting a language school in Bangkok. I’ve enjoyed travelling to Africa and America and Nepal and some other places which are interesting but in the end I think you can’t find a better place on earth than a Thai village and I spend one week every month on my own organic village farm in Isaan, still picking fruit and planting trees. I started collecting country-style antiques when I was in college and then started helping renovate small properties in a Sukhumvit neighborhood where I know everyone and get all the gossip from the beauty salon every week. I like what Americans call “loft style” and I use wood from old houses and country antiques like you might find in a french restaurant but I upgrade everything with modern conveniences.I’ve taught Thai to almost a thousand students, American and European and Japanese, and I have many old friends all over the world from this experience. I like helping people who share my style get started living in Thailand. If I have a property I’m working on that might fit what they need that would be very nice but if I don’t I’m still happy to talk to them.I love books and films and especially old fashioned British costume dramas, my favorite is ""Pride and Prejudice"".

In particular we have a huge heart for SE Asia. Our beautiful honeymoon was spent in Bali where we were charmed everyday by the most lovely experiences. We currently have a small but lovely apartment overlooking the Chao Phrya river in Bangkok as most of my business in fashion keeps me there. When we are stateside we live in Oysterville, Washington, and also own a second home in Portland, Oregon.We are great supporters of the arts and try to see performance as well as exhibits as much as is possible when we travel. Often my business takes me to amazing destinations, as international fashion means international travel as well. My most recent trips have been a month long adventure from that took me and my husband from NYC to London, Milan and Paris to document a fashion week experience. We're considerate and responsible people who understand the importance of trust in renting your place to those you have never met.  We appreciate it when our guests do the same with our two historic homes, one on the charming historic Willapa bay in Oysterville, Washington, the other a beatiful 100+ year old victorian in Portland,OR which is perched high enough upon a hillside for an outstanding city view. Our homes are filled with precious things so we understand the importance of knowing that those things will be taken care of in our absence.Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have; as I will do the same.

My job allows me to travel around the world, experience new cultures and meet interesting folk and I love every minute of it. The great thing about the AirBnB concept is that it allows you to feel right at home in a new city. I personally avoid tourist traps and prefer to explore the neighbourhoods, sample the street food and check out the local watering holes – that’s the best way to get to know a place. But I also know it’s important to feel safe and not sacrifice your creature comforts. That’s why I’ve decided to open the doors to my lovely Bangkok homes, so you too can feel right at home in a foreign land. Don’t be an armchair traveller.

Ice is from Thailand: he is the professional hotelier, restauranteur and chef while I'm the enthusiastic amateur, originally from the UK, who's other job is in advertising.  Bangkok is our home; we 'live above the shop' and love to welcome friends and guests to visit and stay in the Residences - each one has a name (Herma House and Maison ice). In addition, we have a restaurant next door  called Tapi; it serves your breakfast (Thai, Chinese or American) and for lunch and the evening really good, authentic Thai food indoors or outside at night in the garden.  We now have a number of very individual branches of Cafe ice in Bangkok that are happily proving quite popular. When there is time, we love to travel to Europe, America, Australia and to explore other parts of Asia; we try to stay in smaller, more intimate hotels and guesthouses like ours, to exchange ideas and learn from others. Antiques, art, fashion, design, photography and culture & music discovered and rediscovered, in new and familiar places, are of interest, as are the many new friends we are lucky to make on the way.

Bangkok symbolizes all the excitement, craziness and mystery that is Asia. I have lived in Asia since I was 12 but no city is as addictive to me as Bangkok is. This place is the full flavor of the Asian experience, and even with the buzz of a big city I have never felt anything but safe here. I have seen and done almost everything in Bangkok and I can't get enough, this is not a city that easlily bores you.  My interests and work all involve eating, cooking and experiencing the good things in life, I am constantly searching for new places to eat, street food to enjoy and cool places to share time with friends or making new ones. I am interested in fitness and a healthy lifestyle and having as good of a time as possible. Bangkok is well suited in that regard as the possibilities here are endless. I hope to be able to share my best eating spots, nightlife recommendations and Bangkok only tips with people who are likeminded. I hope that your trip is as fantastic and stress free as possible and that you go home as positive about Bangkok as I am. I go out of my way to make your accommodation as comfortable and convenient as possible. I am a relaxed and friendly person but serious about what I do and strive to provide the best and most convenient places to stay in Bangkok.

The wife is a graduate of Mahidol University in Bangkok, and used to work for Thai Airways International but currently holds several even more prestigious positions; School-bus driver, Chef, Head of Housekeeping and general Commander-in-Chief to 2 children and 3 cats.As a family, we love to travel to see and experience new things that open up our perspectives and views of the world. We love the opportunity to expose our children to different cultures and diversities, and learn how the locals of each country live. Because of Taak's background as an Interior Designer, when travelling we tend to look for unique places to stay that are somewhat design-oriented. It does not need to be luxurious in terms of looks, but we believe true luxury is how you feel in a space. We prefer subtle simplicity but with an attention to detail in providing comfort and privacy. Our current favourite destination is Japan, especially Kyoto. And also Switzerland. In fact, we tend to be impressed wherever we go...we just love to travel! Our favourite food would be Thai food (obviously) as well as Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Mexican, French and Korean. And anything BBQ. Love that!Something else about us... Father and Son are avid F1 fans (never miss a race) and are passionate about football, go-kart racing, and Legos.

I was born in Bangkok and grown up in Bangkok, the hometown that I love and wish you love too. Life is short. I wish I could travel around the world, explore new things and experience the way people live, things to eat. I have read a book ""around the world in 80 trades"" written by Conor Woodman. I wish I could travel like him. Right now, I've listed 2 apartments with AirBnB, which located in Rama 1 road where my childhood began. I grown up at Chula Soi 8, walked and played at National stadium. My flashback memory picture was taken at National Stadium garden with my mom and my five gangs elder brothers-in-law. I grown up around here. Therefore, I am proud to present the area where I belong to you. Travel was like a dream when I was childhood. My grandfather asked me to be his companion when I was 7. Just only that conversation, I daydreamed for many days because it would be my first trip aboard. Unfortunately, my grandfather cancelled the trip. Daydreaming collapsed. My first aboard trip was to the UK to study English course for 1 month. I was super excited. It was 11 years old at that time, traveled with schoolmates. I had a good experience. It's still fresh memory, I am so happy when I think about it. I would like to be apart of your good memory when you visit Bangkok. I am please to welcome you to my apartment where the area I belong.

Some family holidays spent in Vietnam during summer 2000 gave me a crush for Asia. I came back in Asia, precisely in Bangkok, for internship purpose during my last year of studies and since never really came back to France, apart from holidays of course.Therefore, I did work for a various type of industries including tourism, textile, corporate gifts, hospitality and even decided to take the challenge launching my own company, running premiums trading and F&B businesses.Off work, I like dining out, mingling with new people, traveling, swimming and watching sports. Arguing is a also a French national sport I do enjoy… softly! I consider myself as being serious and friendly with a humorous behaviour.Being a host on Airbnb are both a pride and a great responsibility. A pride to be offering my private spaces as an unique accommodation alternative in the land of smile; a responsibility to welcoming my guests in the best conditions and, if possible, even exceeding their expectations.I'm looking forward to participating in the success of your beautiful journey in the City of Angels and getting your stay simply smooth as silk.Siamese regards,Eric",within an hour,1.0,1.0,0,,1,1,1,0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2cb5f5d2-4bd4-4413-b937-7694c39303e2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2cb5f5d2-4bd4-4413-b937-7694c39303e2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/45326725

We've been living here all our lives and would never consider moving as it is safe and quiet, yet it is most convenient in the center of Bangkok that is not far from wherever we want to go.

I grew up in Bangkok and spent some years abroad (Texas and London). My hobbies vary from travel, reading, watching Woody Allen's and Wes Anderson's movies to dancing to great music, cooking and eating (most preferred), and having a lot of fun with family and friends. I have a long list of favourite food, from Mexican to Japanese, Italian, Indian, and Thai! I also love chocolate and lots of books.Above anything else, I love exploring the world. If you also one of the travel enthusiast, we will definitely have something in common!

I came here and started living in Bangkok and traveling around the other provinces in Thailand.I noticed something that its difficult to find good place to stay in a budget price. As a solo traveler I met many foriegn travelers and back packersand came to know that many of them were on short budget trip. So they can not pay much for a good place to stay with good location. That gave me an idea to open Savi rooms and here i am :-)Savi rooms offers you different categories of stay in budget price and ensure that you will feel like ""A home away from your home"".Its at one of a prime location of Bangkok, RCA which is famous for its night life with many pubs and discos around like Route66 and Onyx.

They actually serve both as homes as well as hubs to me to be more precise. While in Asia, Bangkok becomes my Asian hub.  I do extensive travelling around the region and also beyond.  Similarly my UK home is my European hub obviously.Whenever I travel, my place in Bangkok becomes unused, hence the idea of letting couples or families wanting the experience of staying in an unusually designed apartment to use. This 160 sq metre apartment spans across two levels on the very top floors of a condominium in the very heart of Bangkok -- the prestigious Ratchadamri area, where several 5 and 6-star hotels are located.I have a huge love and passion in design -- every kind and form of design, including that of a living space.  I design my homes not entirely to make them look good.  My priority is to make a home highly livable and very home, with every details of home living thoroughly considered and taken care of.  Of course, the doing of this can never be at the expense of not having them aesthetically pleasing.I hope you will like the look and feel of this uncharacteristically designed home in Bangkok, and of course eventually enjoy staying in it.

I spent some time in the US and the UK, studying theatre and performing arts and got my PhD in Drama from the University of Exeter. Apart from occasionally acting, I am also a certified yoga teacher and teach private classes, as well as group classes at Yogatique studio in Asok area (check it out!).I love dogs and I'm a proud owner of an Alaskan Malamute (Quint), a Siberian Husky (Kai) and 2 Pomeranians (Care and Code). I love them so much that I name my small pet care brands after them (Quint and Kai)! Bangkok is a relatively pet-friendly city. Even though you won't find people walking their dogs in public parks, there are many pet cafes where you can go and hang out with cute dogs and cats. There are dog swimming pools around the city, and if I am in Bangkok, I usually take them swimming at weekends. So, if you are a pet lover too, we will definitely get along really well! I can show you where to go get pet care products as well (some souvenirs for your pets waiting for you at home?)Thank you for your interest in my listing! I'm looking forward to making new friends.

48069192,Sam,2015-11-03,"Bangkok, Thailand","An ailurophile working for a Fin-Tech start-up in Thailand. I have six house cats, who should *fingers crossed* miss me while I'm away. I started traveling at a young age, thanks to my globe-trotting parents who, due to the nature of their work, now travel even more frequently than me. At 12th grade, I received an AFS scholarship to study in the U.S. There I stayed with a host family in Kansas City, a decent Midwest city with a famous baseball team and barbecue. I moved on to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, studying magazine journalism and international relations, graduated and moved again to Washington D.C., where I interned for a non-profit organization named Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Traveling for me is very much about living like a local. Sure I'll hit some touristy spots, but what I love more than anything is retracing the local way of life. I love nature, and I love convenience. I love tradition, and I love modernity. But they must coexist in an authentic way. I like a place with strong character, be it a tatami house or a yurt, and is comfortable enough that I don't freeze/burn up at night, am able to leisurely take a shower and can sleep without fear of crawly creatures. Privacy is a big concern, but I LOVE interacting with locals and learning from them, so I'm very open to conversations and social gatherings. I'm not a party animal and I don't like big crowds, so if the place is residential, with a live-in host and all the conveniences a local needs nearby, I'm in.

Our motto at BZ27 is ""Eat, sleep & stay local...""""Eat""BZ27 is surrounded by street food vendors & shop house restaurants. Eat out or bring it back to the room. This is how Thai's eat everyday. Authentic as it gets.""Sleep""BZ27 has 39 small apartments in a 5 story walk-up (No elevator). We rent 34 of them out to local students, office workers and others who work in the Sathorn area. We keep 5 rooms for daily rentals. All rooms have been recently renovated and we are vigilant about keeping them as clean as possible. The neighborhood is safe and BZ27's security is very good as well. We have a front gate, second floor accessible by electronic key card for tenants and guest and 16 CCTV cameras.""Stay local""This is the most important aspect for our guests. BZ27 is located in bustling local neighborhood. If do not like to explore and expect easy access to all the tourist destinations, than BZ27 is not for you. Although we are only 2.2km from Surasak BTS station and local transportation & taxis are easy to get, Bangkok traffic is congested. So for all you adventurous folk that I haven't scared off, BZ27 is actually in a great location!Normally I try to meet and greet each guest and help them get settled in, but if you're flying in late or real earlier, I'll probably be sleeping. I do not live at BZ27, so I am around between 9am - 5pm daily. We do however have a key lock box out front to handle 24 hour check ins. Drop me a message if you have any questions.

147744788,Tao,2017-08-26,"Bangkok, Thailand","My name is Tao, Managing Director, Interior Designer, and owner of Baannai.I am taking this opportunity to introduce you to my house which I name it as Baannai, a small and well designed house located in the old Bangkok residential area of Phayathai District.  There are 4 rooms in this house which has been opened since December 2015.  It is right opposite to Samsen railway station and within 10-minutes drive to Ari BTS (Sky train) station and Bangsue  MRT station.  The hotel is close to Ari, hip hang our area of Bangkok, as well as the famous Jatujak Weekend Market.  Other nearby attractions include Phayathai Palace and Sri Ratchawat fresh market.Baannai was the house on the most inner area of the vast family land plot by Samsen Railway station in Bangkok.  It was originally the residence of my great grandfather and his family.   Later, the place became the residence of three of his daughters (known as the Baannai ladies). Back in the days, the houses in this neighborhood only had soil road cut through, with a narrow ditch creating a parallel, and train tracks.  My great grandfather’s family was an extended family just like most Thai people’s in the past. The big family resided together on a big piece of land, divided into the resident area and the kitchen house, lived in by both the masters and servants. Home that was filled with mundane joy and sorrow, harmony, and conflicts; nonetheless, they relied on each other and had a family leader who gave protection to all members. My great aunts - the Baannai ladies- always recalled the life in Baannai back then. The cooks would steam a huge portion of rice for each meal.  As the bell rang signaling lunch or dinner time, small children would gather in a circle having their meal together.  This went on every day.  Just like an old saying, “The family that eats together stays together.” Inspired by the happy recollections of my beloved Baannai ladies combined with my passion in colonial architecture style, I decided to rebuild Baannai to resemble the time when the 3 sisters were young ladies living in the house.  The three upstair rooms – Benjamas (Aster), Malisorn (Jasmine), and Kularb (Rose) are decorated in different style representing the character of each lady to which each room belongs.  The room downstair, Botan (Peony), is decorated in Chinese style, representing the room for the guests of the house.  The lobby of the hotel is also functioned as the dining room of our restaurant.  Selected as one of 'Bib Gourmand' restaurants in the Michelin Guide Bangkok 2018 and 2019, Baannai is famous for its traditional Thai food inspired from the family recipe, some of which are from a cook book hand-written by one of the Baannai ladies herself. What I have is the memory that glows in my hearts. I wish Baannai would bridge the past and the present days and bring happiness, comfort, generosity to all the visitors who make a stop here.  I hope that you will find this information useful and interesting.  I am looking forward to progressive and prosperous future of Baannai with your support.Best regards,Tao",,0.0,0.0,0,,1,1,0,1,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/aa6931f0-cf77-4c01-9a3e-9ecce58a59b2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/aa6931f0-cf77-4c01-9a3e-9ecce58a59b2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/147744788

I think I don't need it anymore. lol When I travel to New York or anywhere in the world. I like to use AirbnbI think it explore the new world of travel experience. You will feel and touchthe local rather than staying at the hotel and of course, cheaper ! 55This is the best way to learn and feel of that country and people.

I'm here because I'm the one who're the same as you guys.

These include the movie room, gaming room, pool table, reading room and board games. Our hostel is located at Pata Department Store, one of the oldest and most renowned department stores in Thailand. Within few steps, our guests could find themselves surrounded with enjoyable places such as the zoo, badminton court, fitness center and arcade gaming. Moreover, one of the most recognizable aspects of Thailand is certainly Thailand's street food. With this matter, we could put it as simply as whatever you can think of, you can find them near us. Tuk Tuk Hostel is also within a walkable distance of Bangkok's landmarks, for example, Wat Phra Kaew or Temple of Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Grand Palace and Khaosan Road.Furthermore, what differentiates us from other hostels is that we are at the center of transportation.

These fond childhood memories have inspired me and my sister to build a hotel on our family land where we can also welcome guests to enjoy the same, wonderful experiences we had when we were young.We are two sisters who founded this newly built hotel located on the Thonburi side of the Chao Praya River on a tract of land belonging to the Xuto family. It is only 15 min-walk to Wat Arun or temple of dawn and right next to the MRT Itsaraphap station ( blue line ) which is scheduled to open in Sep 2019.  Both of us have taken an early retirement from corporate companies to run this hotel with our passion and we  ensure that guests feel perfectly at home with our while getting the hand of Thonburi' s cultural life. We treat our guests like a friend and family members by giving our guests advises on cultural events , things to do and where to go.  The hotel has only ten bedrooms and all spacious and unique in design.   Each room has design inspiration from the local attraction in Thonburi where guests can visit each place easily with our free  map.I (Noom) am  also a painter and love any forms of art like jewelry design to  cartoon drawing.  In our hotel, guests will experience local arts including my painting. Our place is sparkling new , clean with pool and garden.

I don't feel that I have been away for long as I come back to Thailand and the SE Asia so frequent that it's hard to feel detached. Having graduated from the University of the Arts, I worked in London for IPC Media, RICS and recently at the FT for a few years only to realise the more I saw of SE Asia, the more I wanted to spend time there. I now reside here in Bangkok and still consider it one of the most exciting cities in the world. It really is a central hub for everything. It's not hard to fall in love with this city with it's sights & sounds or the wonderful concoction of flavours of food (street or fine dining) that Bangkok has to offer.I love travelling and enjoy visiting historic sites, architecture or simply seeing how people live. I also love food and photography to which fortunately, they all seem to compliment one another. For you foodies, this neighbourhood has some of the best food around. Famous noodle joint 4 mins away, excellent Bibimbap just next to Emporium shopping centre, Wine Connection which has a good selection of western food and is very family friendly.

We enjoy learning new culture, tasting local food, cherishing beauty of nature and making new friends! During our last visit to Europe in Spring 2018, we spent more than 40 nights in AIRbnb houses/apartments and we totally love the experience! So we decided to open our own place for AIRbnb as well. We do hope our future guests will have a great time during their stay in BKK, so we will always make sure that our condominium is clean and in perfect conditions for our guests. [ WEDNESDAY ROUTINE ]Basically we would need to use our condominium everyday wednesday night for Bible Study Group, so that allow us to open our place for AIRbnb for the rest of the week. If you're looking at our listing and want to book your stay which fall on Wed or you intend to book for a long term stay, please feel free to let us know.

Breakfast is served at the communal lounge where all day beverages are available.Each of the 23 accommodations is individually designed a story in itself, be it from the imported antique woods that adorn the floor, the 14’’ high quality bed that guarantees the perfect slumber, or the multi-tasking walk-in shower space plotted amidst granite texture color plus the collage of artworks that adorns the walls crowned off with a splattering of lights above the headboard to set your mood. Blazingly swift free Wi-Fi, large LCD TV, refrigerator, complimentary tea/coffee plus multiple ports to re-charge your devices are all just a touch away.A truly fabulous location offering a broad range of truly international restaurants, lounges, wine bars, coffee shops, noted points include Terminal 21, Emquartier and Emporium shopping malls, a traditional Muay Thai training centre, short stroll to Asoke BTS or Benjakiti Park to keep your jogging or whatever in form makes Aspira D’Andora the perfect choice for a truly inspiring and memorable stay in Bangkok.",within a few hours,1.0,1.0,0,Klong Toey,1,1,0,0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c5194fd6-121e-4bc1-8eec-caab59ec4cbb.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c5194fd6-121e-4bc1-8eec-caab59ec4cbb.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/257460041

36808034,Lalana,2015-06-26,"Bangkok, Thailand","I was born and raised in Bangkok, so I always want to be a good host for my foreigner friends and guests when they're having a trip in my hometown.My background is about marketing but I also studied art history and art business in London. Let me know if you're interested in visiting some nice museums or cool galleries in Bangkok. Or we could go to an exhibition opening together if it's the right time :)I love going to see live musics, mostly jazz. I could name some if you like it too. Sometimes when I'm traveling, I wish I could just chill with my music and relax at my place. So I've got a bluetooth speaker for you guys. Hope you enjoy it!Movies is my best friend. Doesn't matter if it's a Hollywood blockbuster, an independent production or any kind of niche genre. I like Netflix, so I provide that at my place as well. My favorite place at all time, wherever I go or whichever cities I visit, is parks. Unfortunately, there're not many parks in Bangkok. But I'm sure I could recommend some nice parks and you'd love them. My favorite thing to do is traveling. Apart from appreciating beautiful places, it broadens my perspective and shapes me how to live my life somehow. Also meeting nice and cool people is  the best. Basically, I find sharing is beautiful. That's why I prefer staying at Airbnb than hotels, and now become a host.

I don't feel that I have been away for long as I come back to Thailand and the SE Asia so frequent that it's hard to feel detached. Having graduated from the University of the Arts, I worked in London for IPC Media, RICS and recently at the FT for a few years only to realise the more I saw of SE Asia, the more I wanted to spend time there. I now reside here in Bangkok and still consider it one of the most exciting cities in the world. It really is a central hub for everything. It's not hard to fall in love with this city with it's sights & sounds or the wonderful concoction of flavours of food (street or fine dining) that Bangkok has to offer.I love travelling and enjoy visiting historic sites, architecture or simply seeing how people live. I also love food and photography to which fortunately, they all seem to compliment one another. For you foodies, this neighbourhood has some of the best food around. Famous noodle joint 4 mins away, excellent Bibimbap just next to Emporium shopping centre, Wine Connection which has a good selection of western food and is very family friendly.

I prefer to live like a local where possible rather than just stay in hotels. I would like to stay in a cozy place by a river or a farm house where I can explore the natural surroundings.As I mentioned, I've always had a passion for travel. As the Digital Media Manager at an international travel publication, I stay updated on all best places to go to. Some of my favorite trips have been to the US, Switzerland, China, Japan, and New Zealand. The vacation I will always remember the most though was in Santorini, Greece. I love to experience all sorts of different things, from national parks in North America to traditional culture in China to chili crab in Singapore.Photography is my obsession and I never go on a trip without my camera. I love taking pictures of whatever inspires me, but I'm especially moved by natural landscapes.I would be happy to host people and show them around my area.

322674519,Varaporn,2019-12-30,"Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand","I have been working at Rangsit University as an instructor in the faculty of Food Technology for 30 years. My husband is an electrical engineer. I am the second generation of family running apartment business.  Varaphorn House has been well-known for a long term leasing apartment by foreigners who come to work in Bangkok.  Our family business has been run efficiently by my mom for more than 40 years. Now she is old to manage all so that she passed on the baton to me. The tourism business is steadily growing up together with the new trends and innovations. Travel has changed over the last century, from only a few people could afford to that many can accomplish.  Even the place to stay it seems to change from the luxury hotel with full services like restaurants, bar, or gym to the boutique hotel or small one having unique characteristics.  With the aids of applications on mobile or computer, for example,  Airbnb, it makes travellers comfort to choose their own places to stay as wish. I am seeing the opportunity on Varaphorn House to keep up with the new tourism trends.  Since Varaphorn house was built 50 years ago, it was designed by concerning the strength of building, and plenty spaces of living and utility area due to the unlimited space and cheap cost of land in Bangkok at that time.  Today, the modern apartments and condominiums on the other hand, provide narrow rooms due to the limit space and expensive cost of land.  Imagine! staying in the room of 100 sqm comparing with a 25-40  sqm room , which one is more comfortable? With the vintage style, having only10 rooms, a large size 100 sqm of room space, private swimming pool, beautiful garden, and calm environment amid the busy business around here, I am sure that Varaporn House must meet the need of travellers. Thus, I decide to renovate only 2 rooms on the fourth floor with the best view of our house for doing business with Airbnb . Come to stay with us, you will feel like staying at your home.

21131324,Promporn,2014-09-09,"Bangkok, Thailand","Sawasdee ka! Nice to meet you!I'm a busy working mother who lives in Bangkok. I love traveling and I love my family. Traveling with my family, I now prefer accommodations with cooking / kitchen facilities and the extra bedroom and bathroom! That's how I got onto Airbnb and since then I've also enjoyed interacting and making new friends - guests and hosts. To escape the city, Hua Hin is our favourite destination. It is close to Bangkok, isn't too busy, has many good restaurants and things to do. When vacationing I just want to relax and to be outdoors sitting next to the beach. My children love to play on the beach and to swim. Our Resort in Hua Hin offers the best for me and my family as it isn't busy like Hotels, has lots of beautiful outdoor areas and many swimming pools (for my children to explore!). Some people may prefer a more central location, but I like that the Resort is just before Hua Hin, so we can escape the traffic in town.If this sounds like you too, feel free to stay at our Home, or to contact me. FYI, seafood is the best in this area. I have many tips and can share restaurant recommendations with you later. :)",within an hour,1.0,1.0,0,,1,1,0,1,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/41ca77fe-2f0e-47ef-b1c4-38f43d4e1a86.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/41ca77fe-2f0e-47ef-b1c4-38f43d4e1a86.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/21131324

My name is Guillaume, I know it’s difficult to pronounce, sorry for that.I’m a big traveler, I traveled all over Europe and Asia and my favorite places are Germany, Portugal, Morocco, Bali, Japan and of course Thailand. I loved so much Thailand that I decided to live here, on the beautiful island of Koh Phangan.I’m a very curious person so I have many passions, hobbies and center of interest that might seems opposites from each other. I am as much an artist as a scientist. I love to paint, produce and listen to music, do crafts to make things beautiful in my house and am also interested on comptuters, quantum physics, new technologies and meditation.I love science fiction and fantastic books and movies, but I also love good comedies. I love vegan food (I’m vegetarian), Asian food in general and my girlfriend’s food (she’s perfect, I am so lucky)Besides, I decided to work on the psychosomatic field. I try to understand the reasons in the mind or the unconscious that created physical or emotional blocages. That’s a new field discover by science and use by psychologist right know and I find it fascinating. As a host, I refuse that guests make parties, no pets because it’s not allowed in the condominium and no prostitution (I don’t know how to write it with diplomacy but I’m fully aware that it will be difficult to control) for ethical reasons.The most important thing for me as a host is for the guest to be respectful about furniture and apartment itself and of course, neighbors and people working on the condo.Smoking is allowed but only in the balcony (there is fire protection devices inside of the apartment so they can be activated by smoking inside the apartment.)My life motto is that I deeply believe in karma and I try to be the best version of myself and the Universe finds a way to give me back this positive energy!",within an hour,1.0,1.0,0,,1,1,0,1,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/8e931802-d3f0-4a85-9838-8a68a92e9fea.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/8e931802-d3f0-4a85-9838-8a68a92e9fea.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/409999802

Worked in Singapore for 3 years before moving back home. I can speak Cantonese and Mandarin!I love to meet new people, eat, and embark on adventures to explore different parts of the world. Travelling puts my life into perspective: i'm reminded of how minute my problems are in the grand scheme of things and most importantly,  I'm encouraged to live life with a more humble heart. My most memorable destinations to date has been the Sahara Desert in Morocco, Vinicunca Mountain in Peru and, Wadi Rum in Jordan. Let me know where yours are!Designing a home isn't just about choosing a style. It's more of a  platform to share the things I feel deeply passionate about. For me, these are: my love for travelling as well as, my love for hosting. From the welcome baskets to the choice of bedding, I want my homes to be a place where guests feel comfortable, at ease and welcomed.  Stay with me and I'll be sure to introduce you to a local side of Bangkok you've never seen before.NOTE: I will be out of country from June 11 - July 3rd 2022.

While the villas are approximately a half hour, 20km drive from central Bangkok, the serenity, privacy and surroundings give the impression of being many hundreds of miles away from the capital.  For Bangkok's locals, expats or tourists, the villas are an ideal break from city life without the long journey.Green Lung Villas currently has two properties; one 3-bed and one 2-bed. Completely designed for self-catered living, both brand new private villas (est. Jan 2022) have comfy air conditioned living rooms and well equipped kitchens.  The adjoining outdoor spaces feature BBQs and multiple seating areas including dining tables under shady, breezy salas. Each villa has a private 10m pool, a child's paddling area and two sunbeds. All bedrooms are en-suite, air conditioned and fully furnished with blackout curtains, high ceilings and countryside views.For those who prefer more activity than simply relaxing by the pool, the island is well known as a great place to explore on foot or by bicycle. We can also offer boat trips, kickboxing lessons and trips to the botanical park or floating market. There are several excellent restaurants and cafes within 2km of the villas.Your hosts Dtom (Thai / Eng) and David (Eng) personally manage the properties, live next door and can provide help, local knowledge and some supplies that you may need throughout your stay.
